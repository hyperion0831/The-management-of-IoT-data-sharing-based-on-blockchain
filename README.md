# The management of IoT data sharing based on blockchain
The core of this system is to utilize blockchain technology to build an IoT platform for securely sharing smartwatch health data, aiming to provide users with convenience while ensuring robust data security and privacy protection. It collects health monitoring data from smartwatches, enables real-time viewing through a web interface, and sends the data to the server at predefined intervals.

The system uses smart contracts to publish data to a local Ethereum blockchain. The decentralized and tamper-proof nature of blockchain technology ensures that the entire data storage and transmission process is more secure and reliable.

Additionally, the system provides the collected health data to a health analysis platform. By integrating this data, the platform can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the user's health status. This not only enhances the value of the data but also gives users a clearer awareness of their health.

In summary, this system ensures secure sharing of health data while offering precise health analysis services under the premise of privacy protection, achieving a balance between convenience and security.
